<!-- Lesson 2: Assignment | HTML Elements For Content and Layout

1. Embedding Multimedia in Educational Content

Problem Statement: In an era where digital learning is becoming increasingly prevalent, the traditional text-based delivery 
of educational content can fail to fully engage students. This assignment challenges you to incorporate multimedia elements 
into an HTML document designed to teach a simple concept (e.g., the water cycle, basic math principles, or a historical event), 
thereby improving the learner's engagement and understanding.

Task 1: Embed an Educational Image. Create an HTML page and embed an image that illustrates the concept you're teaching. Add 
a caption using the <figcaption> element to describe the image. 
    
Expected Outcome: A web page displaying an image relevant to the educational content, with a caption explaining the image.

Task 2: Include an Instructional Audio Clip Embed an audio clip that provides a brief explanation or reading of the concept. 
Ensure the audio is accessible with playback controls.

Expected Outcome: A web page with an embedded audio clip that plays an explanation of the chosen concept, complete with controls 
for play, pause, and volume.

Task 3: Integrate an Informative Video Incorporate a video that visually explains the concept. The video could be a lecture, an animation, 
or a documentary clip related to the topic.

Expected Outcome: A web page featuring a video that provides a comprehensive explanation or visualization of the concept, enhancing the 
learner's understanding through visual and auditory stimulation.

Completion Criteria:

The HTML document must include at least one example of each multimedia element (image, audio, video) related to the educational content.
Each multimedia element must be appropriately captioned or described to aid understanding.
The page should be structured semantically, with clear headings and descriptive text accompanying each multimedia element to contextualize 
its relevance to the educational content. -->

<!-- 2. Crafting a Semantic Web Document

Problem Statement: In the sprawling landscape of the web, countless pages suffer from poor structure and accessibility, making it challenging 
for both users and search engines to navigate and understand content. This assignment challenges you to build a semantically rich, accessible 
web page on a topic of your choice (e.g., a hobby, a tutorial, or a personal project), using HTML5 semantic elements to organize content logically.

Task 1: Define the Page Structure Use semantic elements to define the basic structure of your web page, including a header, navigation, main content, and a footer.

Expected Outcome: A web page with a clear, logical structure, marked up with semantic elements that delineate the header, navigation, main content, and footer. 

Task 2: Organize Content Using Articles and Sections Within the <main> element, use <article> and <section> tags to organize the content related to your topic. 
Use headings (<h2> to <h6>) to title each section or article appropriately.

Expected Outcome: A semantically structured main content area, with articles and sections that logically separate different topics or ideas related to the main subject.

Completion Criteria:

The web document must employ semantic HTML5 elements to structure the content logically and accessibly.
The page should make appropriate use of <article>, <section>, <nav>, <header>,  <main> , and 
<footer>  elements where relevant to the content.
Headings should be used to structure the content hierarchically, improving both readability and accessibility.

            <h4>Why learn Python?</h4>
            <p>If you are looking for a programming language that is s flexible and easy to read, try learning Python. It is one of the most popular languages today, 
            and programming in Python is used for everything from web and software development to data science and analytics to quality assurance.</p>

        <section id="what-is-python">
            <h4>What is Python?</h4>
            <p> Python is a high-level, interpreted and general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van 
                Rossum and first released in 1991. Python is designed to be easy to learn and use, making it an excellent choice for beginners in computer programming, 
                as well as a powerful tool for experienced software developers.</p>
        </section>
        <article id="python-features">
            <p>Here are some key characteristics and features of Python:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Readable and Expressive:</strong> Emphasizing code readability with a clean and easy-to-understand syntax, Python’s use of indentation to define code blocks 
                    (instead of braces or other delimiters), promotes consistent and clear code.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interpreted Language:</strong> Python is an interpreted language, which means you do not need to compile your code before running it. You can run Python code directly, 
                    which makes the overall development process faster.</li>
                    <li><strong>High-Level Language:</strong> Python abstracts many low-level details, allowing developers to focus on solving problems rather than managing memory or other system-level tasks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-Paradigm:</strong> This is a language that supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented and functional programming.</li>
                    <li><strong>Extensive Standard Library:</strong> Python programming offers a vast standard library that includes modules and packages for various tasks. These include working 
                    with files, data manipulation, networking and web development, among others. This rich standard library reduces the need for third-party libraries in many cases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cross-Platform:</strong> Available on various computer operating systems, Python is highly versatile and portable. Computer code written in Python can often be run on 
                    different platforms with minimal or no modifications.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic Typing:</strong> Python uses dynamic typing, which means that you do not need to declare variable types explicitly. The interpreter infers the data type 
                    of a variable during runtime.</li>
                    <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> Python is an open-source programming language, which means it is freely available for anyone to use, modify and distribute. This has contributed 
                        to its widespread adoption and the creation of a vibrant community of Python developers. 
                    <li><strong>Large and Active Community:</strong> Python has a large and active community of developers and enthusiasts. This community contributes to the language’s growth, maintains 
                        third-party libraries and provides extensive documentation and support.
